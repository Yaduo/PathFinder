# PathFinder
### A Android application (target=android-20) for comparing the difference among the various path finding algorithms, such as DFS, BFS, Dijkstra (not implement) and A*
* Implemented the DFS (Depth First Search) by using a Stack; BFS (Breadth First Search) by an Queue; and  A* search by a Priority Queue 
* Recode the paths (searching step) into a HashMap, and draw these steps by using Canvas
* Implemented the game logic control system by using multi-thread, such as game start, speed up and slow down
